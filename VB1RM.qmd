# Estimating 1 Rep Max

## What is 1RM?

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(vembedr)

#embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlYgnf_qCNo")
```

## Methods for finding 1RM

## Velocity Based vs Traditional Methods

## Velocity Based Methods

The standard test used to determine the individual L-V relationship consists of recording MV against multiple submaximal loads (≈5 loads) and, subsequently, modeling the L-V relationship through a linear regression to estimate the 1RM as the load associated with the MV of the 1RM (V1RM)

Because of the low reliability of the individual V1RM (6,29,73), and the trivial differences between the between- and within-subject variability for the V1RM (70), the use of a general V1RM for all subjects could be recommended to simplify the testing procedure.

we recommend the use of MV to estimate the 1RM because of its greater reliability (when compared with MPV) when lifting light relative loads

Considerations for coaches using 1RM estimates from velocity

the relationship between the MV recorded during a single repetition and the %1RM may be influenced by the type of exercise (e.g., squat versus leg press (13,38,75), execution technique (e.g., concentric-only vs. eccentric-concentric (28,65), sex (higher values for men at lower %1RM) (3,84), and measurement device

the MV-%1RM relationship, especially at light relative loads, is subject-specific

overestimation of the data fit because of the presence of autocorrelation because authors included more than one observation from the same participant to calculate the general L-V relationships

-   Slope intercept formula

$y = mx + b$ -----\> $x = \frac{y-b}{m}$

-   Minimum Velocity Threshold (MVT)

-   Force-Velocity Balance (slope)

-   Curve Score / Total Power (area under curve)

-   Lzero - Velocity at zero load

-   Vzero - Load at zero velocity
